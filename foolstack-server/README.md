# Foolstack Server

This server is built using Grails, JDK 11, and MongoDB.

To run the server locally, ensure you have Grails, MongoDB, and JDK 11 installed as well as JAVA_HOME and GRAILS_HOME configured in your system variables.

Create the MongoDB database (if you have not already) by changing directories into your MongoDB bin directory and running `use foolstack` or simply creating a database named 'foolstack' in MongoDBCompass

Once you are set up clone the repo and run `grails run-app` to run the server on port 8080
