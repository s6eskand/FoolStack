# Foolstack Client

The client for Foolstack was built with React. To edit any components or run the application locally ensure you have node and an updated version of npm installed.

Clone the repository then run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

If all dependencies are installed run `npm start` to run the application on port 3000.

Unless grails server is also running locally, no live data will be pulled from the server. This will be updated such that a test server is constantly running and all the data stored will be shared across all devices.
